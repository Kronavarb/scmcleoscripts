74. -Ooscar's Tips #1:	Made-Up		Ok some people may wonder how to create a simple mission script or whatever to activate one of these codes
well,lemme show u!!!!!!:)

				1-first download Cleo 3 Library/Cleo or whatever
				2-next download Sanny Builder 3
				3-Make a folder where your going to keep all your work!:)
				4-Next Make a new text document and name it what your mod's name is!
				5-Now in your new text document, type this exact code if u want to activate your mod automatically
				(only works with some codes):

				{$CLEO}
				0000:

				while true
				  wait 250
				    (Insert Mod's Code Here)
				end
				
				it may seem as though the code looks stupid and is indented and/or has too much spacing
				but trust me it works if done right!

				6-in the part that says (Insert Mod's Code Here) highlight from the first paranthesis to the last
				and past your code in there!
				7- now, if you want to press F4 to activate your mod(only works with some codes) then copy this code:

				{$CLEO}
				0000:

				while true
				  wait 250
				  if
				    0AB0:   key_pressed 0x73
				  then
				    (Insert Mod's Code Here)
				  end
				end


				and paste your code on the (Insert Mod's Code Here) part!:)
				8-Now open up Sanny Builder 3 after you have already installed it!:)
				9-Now open up the text file you just made!:) with sanny builder 3
				10-Next, go to the 'tools' option and go to 'Code Converter' and press MB -> SB
				11-wait a minute.....now that your code is converted, it creates another text file called 
				(whatever the name of the code is)_conv!
				12-now you have two text files with different names but the same writing, ok, now close everything	
				and go to the folder with all your work!
				13-you might want to delte the old (first) text file, as it is no use to you!:)
				14-open up Sanny Builder 3 again but this time open up the new text file that was converted from the old one,
				now that its open, time to code it!
				15-go to the sanny builder 3's option called 'run' and press 'compile' and a screen should pop up talking about something, just 				press ok, and your done!
				16-install the Cleo Library by putting the folder called 'CLEO' in the GTA SA's main directory
				17-copy the '.cs' file(your mod) that you made from your folder, and paste it in the CLEO Folder
				18-run GTA SA and test it out
				19-Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
